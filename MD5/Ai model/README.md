Cracking MD5 hashes using neural network LSTM & seq2seq  model

<font size = '500'> What is LSTM ? </font>
- LSTM stands for long short-term memory networks, used in the field of Deep Learning. It is a variety of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, especially in sequence prediction problems.

What is seq2seq model ?
- A Seq2Seq model is a model that takes a sequence of items (words, letters, time series, etc) and outputs another sequence of items.
Seq2Seq Model In the case of Neural Machine Translation, the input is a series of words, and the output is the translated series of words.
