This is a Python implementation of a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) for generating passwords. The CGAN is composed of a generator network and a discriminator network, and is trained on a dataset of passwords to generate new passwords that are similar to those in the dataset.

The generator network takes as input a random noise vector and a conditioning vector that encodes additional information about the password to be generated (such as the username or some other characteristic), and outputs a vector representing the generated password.

The discriminator network takes as input a password vector and a conditioning vector, and outputs a probability that the password is real (i.e., from the dataset) rather than generated by the generator network.

The CGAN is trained using a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. The discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated passwords, while the generator is trained to generate passwords that can fool the discriminator.

The code includes functions to build and train the CGAN, preprocess the password data, and generate new passwords. It also includes a sample dataset of passwords for training and testing the CGAN.

To use the code, simply run the main script and adjust the hyperparameters as needed. The generated passwords can be saved to a file for later use.
